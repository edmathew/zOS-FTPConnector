# zOSFTPConnector
An abstraction on using zOS FTP Functionalities.
This project borned as a spin-off from my small utils witch used zOS FTP functionalities.

IBM zOS (System Z) has a cool (but kinda rusty) FTP Server.
You can send and receive files (obviously) but you also can submit batch jobs and get the respective results.
